The aim of our project is Design an RC phase shift oscillator circuit/circuits to generate a set of sinusoidal signals and combine them to generate a clock pulse of arbitrary frequency which drives a sequential digital up counter.
working principle of RC phase shift oscillator (How transistors are used to generate sinusoidal signals wit ha specific frequency)
Making specific design for each oscillator circuit to generate corresponding sinusoids
Adding the sinusoids with an adder circuit to generate a square wave (You can simulate using Fourier analysis as well)
Using the generated square wave as a clock to a FF based counter (counts up to 15)
The FALSTAD is the major tool used to make the circuits.
